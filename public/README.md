### Feature #1: Refactor the CSS

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- We are implementing this feature to make sure the css follows SMACCS and is easier to change in the future.

#### What are we going to implement?

We are splitting up the css from one file to be on 3 files: base, layout, and modules.

#### How are we implementing it?

- I refactored the `main.css` file using SMACSS principles. I split the css into 3 files. 1 for base styling that affects almost everything. Layout is for css that affects main items and the main layout of the page. Modules is for styling that affects smaller elements and color choices.
